## Contributing
 Add anything to this that would be valuable as a public resource for other Desmos users/artists/creators/programmers/et cetera. This can be core Desmos features, clever uses of Desmos features, good practices, and a whole lot of other stuff. Formatting and standards for this site in general are still pending.
